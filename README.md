## Features

- **Encapsulation:** The project utilizes encapsulation to group related data and functions, restricting access to the internal details of the system's components.

- **Polymorphism:** Through polymorphism, the system allows objects of different types to be treated as objects of a common base type, enabling flexibility and extensibility.

- **Inheritance:** Inheritance is employed to create a hierarchy of classes, facilitating code reuse and structuring the system in a logical manner.
